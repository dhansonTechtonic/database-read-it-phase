# Reading and Commenting Code Lesson

## Review
- [ ] **Ask questions to determine if the previously taught content was absorbed/understood and address misconceptions if needed**
- [ ] **Ask about learners' previous experience/familiarity with the topic at hand**

How comfortable would you say you are with reading code? Do you ever get stuck reading code? What does commenting out code do for the developer?

- [ ] **State main goal of covering this topic**

The main goal of covering this topic is to give students practice reading and annotating code so that they are familiar with this practice and can read and understand large code bases on the floor.

## Overview
- [ ] **Provide a general overview of the new topic/concept**

Reading and understanding code can be difficult so it is best to step through code one line at a time and one file at a time. Commenting out what is happening in the code can help with understanding it later.

- [ ] **Explain what students can expect during this learning session**

Students can expect to be given a code base that they will read, interact with, and then comment on.

- [ ] **Refer to the resources below to think through your lesson**

- [ ] **Create and state the content learning objectives using a "Students will be able to... (SWBAT)" statement, Bloom's action verbs, and the forms and functions of language that students will use to display their learning**

Students will be able to know how to read and understand code as well as have an understanding of how to comment code effectively.

- [ ] **Give context around how mastery of this concept ties into the overarching learning goal from the review section**

Mastery of this concept will give students a deeper understanding of how to read/navigate different code bases of varying sizes.

- [ ] **Orient them as to why this learning is important and what it's benefits are for them**

Learning how to read code is important because this is what the students will be doing as developers and they need to know how to read and understand a large code base quickly.

## Presentation

### I DO:
- [ ] **Refer to the resources below to think through your lesson I DO, WE DO, and YOU DO components**

  - [Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures](https://sirblois.files.wordpress.com/2016/09/cooperative-learning-activities.pdf)

  - [Nine Essential Learning Strategies](https://www.inflexion.org/download/37903/)

- [ ] **Describe the general concept, making links to what students have seen before**

The general concept is talking about what is happening in the code and then writing that in the comments. It's like describing a machine or procedure or recipe.

- [ ] **Discuss steps involved**

Step through the provided codepen and talk about what is going on in the code. Comment the code as you go along and be as descriptive with your comments as possible.

- [ ] **Discuss new terms/definitions involved**

    pseudocode: an informal high-level description of the operating principle of a computer program or other algorithm

- [ ] **Demonstrate steps involved with metacognitive dialogue (think-alouds)**

  - [Think-Aloud Protocol](https://www.teachervision.com/problem-solving/think-aloud-strategy)

  - [3 Steps for Think-Alouds](http://www.ascd.org/publications/newsletters/education-update/feb18/vol60/num02/3-Steps-for-Think-Alouds.aspx)

- [ ] **Share examples**

    [Currying](https://codepen.io/delihanson/pen/zYYxVpQ?editors=0010)

- [ ] **Instructors teach new content/language**

- [ ] **Group discussions - allow students to articulate what they saw you do**

Did what I say the code is doing actually match your perception of what is happening in the code? Did I describe it in an order that made sense?

## Exercise

### WE DO:
- [ ] **Present content that allows everyone to contribute to creating something functional (fill-in-the-blank, white-boarding a plan together, having teams or individuals write and share the logic for executing the plan, drafting a program together, something collaborative that allows them to confirm their thinking and see something work or be led through what to do if it fails)**

Help students step through the code to explain and comment what is going on in it.

- [ ] **Instructor acts as a facilitator**

Have the students tell you what to comment on which line of code.

- [ ] **Have learners explain how and why using the language objectives as many times and ways as possible**

- [ ] **Allow time for observations and questions**

- [ ] **Instructors prompt learners to apply new content/language**

Then have the students pair up and explain to each other what is happening in the code and then pick on someone to share out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### YOU DO:
- [ ] **Assign an individual practice opportunity for students to engage in learning and grapple with the content**

Have the students comment the code themselves

- [ ] **Provide extension activities for speedy learners**

If they get done early have the students help other students.

- [ ] **Provide break-out sessions to facilitate small-group relearning for those who are struggling (mini-lessons on blockers)**

- [ ] **Instructors reinforce and assess learners' application of new content/language**

Have someone come up and put in the codepen under YOU DO how they solved the problem.

## Summary
- [ ] **Highlight the key points of the lesson**

What is reading code? How do we comment code? Why is it important to learn how to do?

- [ ] **Review the learning objectives with the class**

- [ ] **Allow students to ask and answer questions again**

- [ ] **Instructors assess learners' application of new content/language via formative assessment (exit tickets) or summative assessment (unit test)**

## Self-Assessment and Lesson Reflection

- [ ] **Take notes after you teach a lesson! When you make notes of the successes and changes you want, it is easier to remember next time**

- [ ] **Summarize, interpret, and consider the gains in academic performance levels of students in relation to where students were prior to instruction, the context in which teaching and learning occurred, and the implications of this analysis for oneâ€™s own professional effectiveness and development**

- [ ] **Reflection questions may include:**

  - How did the class do as a whole?


  - Based upon circumstances in which you were teaching, are there any conclusions you can make?
  

  - What would you do differently next time you teach this lesson?
  

  - What worked well?
  

  - How did you utilize prior student involvement and feedback?
  

  - Were all texts and additional resources appropriate?


  - How have you personally grown as a teacher from this lesson?
