# database-read-it-phase
## Overview
- The point of this exercise is to help students be able to read and understand code as well as explain in either a written or oral way what is happening in code. This will increase students' overall comprehension of code and will give them practice since they will be knee deep in new code bases once they hit the floor.

## Instructions
1. Open up the index.html file by right clicking on it in VS Code and selecting *Open with Live Server*. If this option does not pop up please ask an instructor for assistance.

2. Play around with the UI to get a feel for what exactly is going on in the web application. What problem is solved? What's the purpose of the application? What functionality does it have?

3. Now go to the database.js and make a comment at the top of the file explaining what the purpose of the file is.

4. Do the same for the index.html and the styles.css files. Make sure to also add any observations you've made about that file i.e. "The styles.css is organized by section and is separated by comments".

5. Lastly, go to the index.js file. For this file, write the purpose of each function at the top of the function in a comment. Then comment out line by line what is happening in that function and how it connects to the UI, i.e. "This line here binds the input field to the handleInput function so when I type in the input field the handleInput function is called."

6. Don't forget to add questions about the code that you have as well as critiques! My code isn't perfect so feel free to respectfully rip into it.
